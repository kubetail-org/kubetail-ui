# Kubetail-UI

Kubetail-UI is the fun, new, easy way to add Kubetail shared styles and React components to your Kubetail-related apps and projects.

## Quickstart

To use Kubetail-UI, first install the Kubetail-UI JavaScript library and its required dependencies:

```console
pnpm install @kubetail/ui react react-dom tailwindcss
```

Assuming you've already configured your project to use Tailwind v4, the next step is to import the Kubetail-UI stylesheet into your main CSS file:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@import '@kubetail/ui';
@source '../node_modules/@kubetail/ui/**/*.js';

@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *));
```

Now you can use all of Kubetail-UI's custom styles with Tailwind's utility classes and import components from `@kubetail/ui`:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@kubetail/ui/elements/button';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1 className="text-heading-4xl">My Cool Project</h1>
        <div className="text-2xl">This is a box with color &quot;bg-error-strong&quot;:</div>
        <div className="h-[100px] w-[100px] bg-destructive" />
        <Button variant="outline" size="lg">Click me</Button>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Fonts

When you import the `@kubetail/ui` css file it automatically applies the following font styles:

```css
@layer base {
  body {
    @apply antialiased;
    font-feature-settings: "rlig" 1, "calt" 1;
  }
}
```

However, this library doesn't load font files for you or set a custom default font family. Picking fonts and ensuring the files are available in the browser is left up to you (though for custom fonts we recommend using variable fonts from FontSource).

## Light/Dark Mode

This library is dark-mode ready but you must choose how you want Tailwind to detect the mode and configure it for your project ([https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)).
